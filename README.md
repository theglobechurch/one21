> …I’ve thoroughly enjoyed doing One21 and reading the Bible with an older student named Sarah. One21 has been very helpful in solidifying and going deeper into that week’s sermon. I for one, so often love a week’s sermon and come out feeling so passionate, but quickly forget during the weeks. One21 has been great for going over the main points. God has spoken deeper and more specifically to me from it, overall helping me apply it to my week and life. I’d definitely encourage you (and myself) to try it and use it more often with someone.
